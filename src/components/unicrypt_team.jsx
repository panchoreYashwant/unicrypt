                Thank you for taking the time to read these thoughts from the
                Unicrypt team. We
                <br /> sincerely hope that whoever you are and/or represent,
                that you will enjoy the
                <br /> services and utilities provided by the Unicrypt
                ecosystem.

              Unicrypt is driven by <b>passion</b>. The very same passion which
              animates its core members and <br /> community. Built from the
              ground up in June 2020 (no fundraising, ICOs, etc. Genesis here!),
              the <br />
              green Unicorn found its inspiration from the geniuses that
              invented the <b>Uniswap</b> protocol - if you
              <br /> ever read this Hayden, you guys are the best.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's worth mentioning that our <b>community</b> permanently tries
              to be <b>constructive</b>, and that
              <br /> definitely makes us different. Our community continues to
              lay the
              <br /> foundations on which the ethos, and the utility, of
              Unicrypt is built.
            </p>
            <p>
              Criticism is necessary, no matter if it's good or bad, so long as
              we can learn something from the
              <br /> hundreds of conversations we handle on a daily basis. That
              being said, focusing on our
              <br /> communities allows the green unicorn (us!) to position
              itself as a reference from a product-
              <br />
              market fit standpoint.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our roadmap is simple:{" "}
              <b>Automated, Decentralized, Scalable multi-chain</b> technology.
            </p>
            <p>Everyone is welcome.</p>
            <p>Together, we are stronger.</p>
            <p>Keep it up, Unicrypt family!</p>
